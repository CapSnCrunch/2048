# 2048 in Python
Very basic implementation of 2048 in pygame useful for testing various gaming input devices in Python.

## How to Use
Make sure you have pygame installed and look in the main function. Replace the conditions under 'ADD NEW INPUT CONDITIONS HERE' with whatever you want to trigger different moves with. Feel free to also just play with the keyboard arrow keys.
